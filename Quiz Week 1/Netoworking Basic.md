| Question NO. | Question | Correct Answer |
|---------------|----------|----------------|
|1| A network segment where only one device can communicate at a time is known as a _____. | A **collision domain** is the term used to describe a network segment where collisions may occur -- that is, a network segment where only one device can successfully communicate at a time. |
|2 | MAC address stands for ____ address. | A MAC ( **Media Access Control**) address is sometimes also referred to as a hardware address.|
|3 | The most common data link layer protocol for wired connections is _____. | The most common data link layer protocol you'll run into is **Ethernet**. |
|4 | A device that connects lots of devices and remembers which ones are connected to each interface is known as a _____. | |
|5 | UDP stands for ______. |**User Datagram Protocol** is one of the more common transport layer protocols. |
|6 | What is the fifth layer of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model? | The fifth layer of the TCP/IP model is the **application layer**. The application layer focuses on application specific protocols. |
|7 | Which two protocols work at the transport layer and ensures that data gets to the right applications running on those nodes? | **UDP** works at the transport layer and is responsible for ensuring data gets to the right applications.UDP does not provide reliable delivery. <br/> **TCP** works at the transport layer and is responsible for ensuring that data gets to the right applications. TCP provides reliable delivery. |
|8 | A system has defined specifications that describe how signals are sent over connections. Which layer of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model provides this function? | |
|9 | You have installed a device at the physical layer. All of the systems you connect to this device will talk to each other at the same time. What have you installed? | A **hub** is a physical layer device that allows for connections from many computers at once.|
|10 | A user logs on to a laptop and opens her email. What device will provide emails to the laptop?  | A **server** is anything that provides data to a client. |
|11 | You get in your car after work and turn on the radio. What type of communication does the radio use? | A radio provides one way communication, or unidirectional. This is **simplex** communication. |
|12 | A Local Area Network (LAN) uses Category 6 cabling. An issue with a connection results in a network link degradation and only one device can communicate at a time. What is the connection operating at? | A full duplex connection that has a connection issue will report itself to be operating as **half duplex**. |
|13 | A communications closet has a device that contains 48 ports. The device's sole function is to provide the ports. What type of device is in the closet?  | A **patch panel** is a device containing many network ports, but it does no other work. |
|14 | A user is operating Client A and sends a message to Client B. What is used to identify the node the transmission is meant for? | A **MAC address** is a globally unique identifier attached to an individual network interface. A MAC is used to identify which node the transmission is meant for. |
|15 | What immediately follows the Start Frame Delimiter in an ethernet frame? | The **destination MAC address** immediately follows the Start Frame Delimiter. |
|16 | Where is the Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) found in an ethernet frame? | The SFD is found in **the last byte of the preamble**, and signals to a receiving device that the preamble is over, and that the actual frame contents will now follow. |
|17 | The technique that allows you to have multiple logical LANs operating on the same physical equipment is known as a _____. | A **VLAN** is a way to use a single set of physical equipment in more than one way. |
|18 | When an electrical pulse on one wire is accidentally detected on another nearby wire, this is known as _____.  | **Crosstalk** is reduced by the way that wires are twisted inside of a cable. |
|19 | TCP stands for ______. | **Transmission Control Protocol** is one of the more common transport layer protocols. |
|20 | What layer in the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model does IP use? | **The network layer** is also sometimes called the internet layer. The most common protocol used at this layer is Internet Protocol (IP). |
|21 | What will allow you to form point-to-point networking connections?  | Cables allow you to form point-to-point networking connections. |
|22 | A user logs on to a laptop and opens her email. What device will provide emails to the laptop? | |
|23 | What process sends ones and zeroes across network cables? | Ones and zeroes are sent across network cables through a process called **modulation**.|
|24 | What is used to determine when the communications channels are clear and when a device is free to transmit data? | Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (**CSMA/CD**) is used to determine when the communications channels are clear and when a device is free to transmit data. |
|25 | What section in an ethernet frame will you find a Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) header?  | You may find a VLAN header in the **EtherType field**. This will indicate that the frame is called a VLAN frame.|
|26 | Which section in an ethernet frame contains the data from higher layers, such as Internet Protocol (IP) and the transport and application layers? | The **payload** contains all of the data from higher layers, such as the IP, transport, and application layers, that's actually being transmitted. |
|27 | The number system that has 16 numerals is known as _____. | **Hexadecimal** |
|28 | A user has multiple web pages open and is using email. Which layer of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model is responsible for sorting the data to send email and web pages to the appropriate location? | The **transport layer** is responsible for sorting out which client and server programs are supposed to get data. |
|29 | A system has defined specifications that describe how signals are sent over connections. Which layer of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model provides this function? | |
|30 | What device forwards data and operates at layer three of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model?  | A **router** is a device that knows how to forward data between independent networks and operates at layer three.|
|31 | How many wires are in a standard Category 6 cable? | A standard Cat6 cable has *8 wires* that consist of four twisted pairs inside of a single jacket. |
|32 | You need to identify the manufacturer of a network interface. Where will you look for this information?  | *The first three octets of a MAC address* are known as the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI). These are assigned to individual hardware manufacturers.|
